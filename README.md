# RojoPy
<b>Ronnie's SAS Python Work</b>
<br>
This will contain python programs that I write which I believe will be of use to the IOM team particuarly and particularly going ahead with Viya.
<br>
This is a public repository.
<br>
The master branch will have what I considered completed/ready for (internal) use version of programs
<br>
Other work/test cases I am commiting to other branches (such as rojo-workpacth1)
<br>
Feel free to upload your own code but let's make this all python only
<br>
<br>
Just clone the repository and have at it!
