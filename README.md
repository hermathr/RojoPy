# RojoPy
Ronnie's SAS Python Work
This will contain python programs that I write which I believe will be of use to the IOM team particuarly and particularly going ahead with Viya.

This is a public repository.

The master branch will have what I considered completed/ready for (internal) use version of programs

Other work/test cases I am commiting to other branches (such as rojo-workpacth1)

Feel free to upload your own code but let's make this all python only

Just clone the repository and have at it!

  git clone https://github.com/hermathr/RojoPy.git
  cd RojoPy
